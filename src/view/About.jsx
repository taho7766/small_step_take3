                Hi! I&apos;m Taewoo, and I aspire to be a software developer. This website marks my first successful project using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. 
                Iâ€™m currently exploring various fields within computer science to find my specialty. I have a growing interest in autonomous systems as I believe they have significant potential to enhance human productivity and, most importantly, safety.
                 Driven by this interest, I have recently started experimenting with computer vision and deep learning.

                    My favorite part about this field is the type of people I meet. I am a firm believer in open communication.
